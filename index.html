			<h2>You Already know The Fun</h2>
			<p>The problem nowadays is the bad men 
roam free doing as they please, and the women are drawn to them like flies on sh*t without any good solid men (patriarchs) to protect them, prevent them from making dumb decisions, and to punish the predators as justice and honour demands.
So really it's just a free for all buffet on women for villains right now.

The shepherd is absent, the sheep pen is open and the wolves are having orgies.

Then the sheep come out of the pen wobbled leg bleating about how terrible shepherds are after what that wolf did to them.
In a sense they're right, the shepherds are terrible - just not for the reasons they say they are. They are terrible for failing in their duty of care to protect and preserve - they are not terrible because you conflate a shepherd with a wolf and that wolf put you through hell.
The shepherds crime is failing to protect you from hell, the wolves is intentionally putting you through it and enjoying every moment of it - let that be clear.

Also let it be known that whilst any man has the potential to be a wolf, only spouses and family men can be shepherds</p>
